# Spring Boot + Junit 5 + Testcontainers

## Intro and Motivation
This is an example of a fresh Spring Boot project that has an integration test that
uses JUnit 5 (Jupiter) and a Testcontainer for its database. I created this project
because I found this process to be more painful than I expected due to most guides
using JUnit 4. I also created this project because it felt too painful, and I am
interested in learning how other people have solved this problem.

## Build Instructions

I set this to use Java 17, but it should work fine on most somewhat current versions
of java if you tweak the pom.

`mvnw clean install`

The purpose of this project is to show how to make tests like this, so that's
all you really need to know.

## Feedback

Please make an issue; I'm interested to hear your feedback.
